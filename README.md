# Do You Really Need to Pay 2/20? Hedge Fund Strategy Replication via Machine Learning

Master dissertation, published on SSRN https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4243861 


this project code is split into 3 parts:
data cleaning+benchmark: the benchmark used for replicate linear hedge fund replication.
GAN: all the gan models 
autoencoders: the actual model is in encapsulate.py, and autoencoder_V4 contain measurement of the result.


directory:
data file is the raw data used in data cleaning 
cleaned data is the output of data cleaning
GAN contains all mutations of the model proposed in the paper

I wish i had more time in refining those models, cleaning up and ensemble the prediction/data generation by GAN, but unfortunately it is a master dissertation, i only have 2 months from writing code to writing paper.
